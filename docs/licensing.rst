Why this License?
-----------------

While we believe, respect and are thankfull for the `GNU Project <https://www.gnu.org/>`_ and the `FSF <https://www.fsf.org/>`_, the `AGPL license <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html>`_ does not align best with this project's intrests or goals.

The goal of this project is to provide a free state-of-the-art hospital operations management and electronic health records software at no cost to the world in order to improve healthcare for all people regardless of any condition.

It is framed into charity, it does not seek profit but financing its costs for the sake of providing its mission.

In order to better achieve its mission, the less barriers for its adoption, the better.

The greater adoption, the richer ecosystem will be.

The richer ecosystem, greater the software will become.

Greater the software, greater the health care.
